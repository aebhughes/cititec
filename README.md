===========

Project named before the client was known.

Assumptions
----------

-   The data concerned will not exceed what can comfortable fit in memory.
    For large datasets, list processing would have to be changed to a
    match-merge processing model.
-   The *total* number of tracks (as opposed to the total *unique* tracks)
    is used in the final display calculations.
-   No set-up.  First run of the script or first run of a new user will 
    automaticlly create the data file.
-   One data file per user
